1. npm install first of all & npm run start
2. Worked without eslint, because i have extention and not to spend too much time on configuration.
3. Design is not the best, because is hard to work without design file :)
4. Added craco, because of xml parser "xml2js", didn't find one without problems, thats why I used craco, with craco config and fallbacks that were in terminal as warnings.
5. Added in package json proxy, that were cors errors to eurogamer api.
6. Could add a Error boundary arond the application, but also could take extra time to setup it ))
